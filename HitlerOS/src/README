This is just a fun interest project. I am a 14 year old programmer. When I researched about
Unix, I was so amazed to make a command-line operating system. You can't call this an 
operating system because it's just a C program that runs by a compiler. But still
this is the most amount of code and the biggest project i've ever worked on. You can 
modify, distribute this under my certificate. Contact here: mdwayes4044@gmail.com.
